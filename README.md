## The Concept

The double-slit experiment is one of the most famous and counterintuitive experiments in all of physics. Reading about it can be confusing, as it describes particles like electrons behaving as waves when unobserved, but as particles when observed.

This project was inspired by the "Quantum World" manuscript's goal of making quantum physics accessible. I wanted to move beyond a static text explanation and create a hands-on experience. This simulator allows users to discover the bizarre results for themselves, building intuition around a concept that defies common sense. The goal is to create that "aha!" moment when the user toggles the detector and witnesses the wave pattern instantly vanish.

## Key Features

- **Particle-by-Particle Simulation:** Fire single electrons to see their seemingly random individual impacts, then fire thousands to see the mysterious wave-like interference pattern emerge over time.
- **Interactive Observer Effect:** The core of the demo. A simple toggle switch allows the user to add a "detector" to the slits. This action fundamentally changes the outcome of the experiment, collapsing the wave function and proving the observer's role in quantum mechanics.
- **Visualized with HTML Canvas:** The entire experiment is dynamically drawn and updated using the HTML Canvas API, demonstrating a more advanced frontend skill for creating custom graphics and animations.
